# Finviz Analytics
What is Finviz?Â¶
FinViz aims to make market information accessible and provides a lot of data in visual snapshots, allowing traders and investors to quickly find the stock, future or forex pair they are looking for. The site provides advanced screeners, market maps, analysis, comparative tools and charts.

# Why?
Stock markets are rarely truly efficient.  However panicked markets can be highly volatile, subject to emotional investing, global demand for stability and more activly managed portfolios. 
To generate wealth and long term intrinsic value during uncertain times I'll leverage the unofficial python API for FinViz to create custom stock screeners to identify value..
